# Goko 

Goko is a website for a community me and my cousin made. Its abbreviation of our little names - (Koko, Gogo).

# Purpose üéØ

Our purpose is to make useful apps for our community which for now is based on League of Legends and FiveM (Grand Theft Auto 5 Roleplay).

### League of Legends üèÜ

League of Legends is a very special game for us, because we have been playing it for 6 years now. As of that we decided to make a match history viewing app, where you can store your favourite games in your personal colletion as well as share your favourite games by copying a link and sending it to your friends. 
On top of that you can see recent news on League Of Legends home page.

### FiveM üêå

###### FiveM is a framework for GTA V, which allows for people to play on multiplayer server, mostly roleplay ones, for free (as long you have GTA V).

After long playing in random server we decided it is time to make our own one. So we present to you [Goko Roleplay](https://discord.gg/R2eqjFPzAy). In our website there is a home page specifically for this server, where you can find a Forum to share your opinion for the server, as well as applications for whitelist jobs and list of live online players.
